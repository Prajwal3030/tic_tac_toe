## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot find module" errors**
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

**Port already in use**
- Change the port in server.js or use a different port
- Kill the process using the port: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`

**Connection issues**
- Check if the server is running
- Verify the correct URL is being accessed
- Check firewall settings

**Socket.io connection errors**
- Ensure the Socket.io client library is loading
- Check browser console for errors
